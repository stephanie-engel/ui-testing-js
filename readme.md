# Running Tests
As long as you have a browser installed on your machine, you can run this test suite with one of the following commands:
`npm run chrome-tests` OR `npm run firefox-tests` OR `npm run safari-tests` (there are additional commands that are included in the package.json in the `scripts` property).
- TestCafe's webdriver will automatically detect the specified browser driver on your machine (no need to manually download and install a separate browser driver!)
