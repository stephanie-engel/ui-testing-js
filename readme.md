# Running Tests

As long as you have a browser installed on your machine, you can run this test suite with one of the following commands:

`npm run chrome-tests`
`npm run firefox-tests`
`npm run safari-tests` 

There are additional test run commands (for other browsers) that are included in the package.json in the `scripts` property.

- TestCafe's webdriver will automatically detect the specified browser driver on your machine (no need to manually download and install a separate browser driver!)
